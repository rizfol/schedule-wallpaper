Used code from here: https://github.com/KananVyas/BoxDetection

This program extracts schedule info from an image then sticks it together to create a wallpaper for your phone lock screen

How to use:

1. clone this repo into your own workspace
2. create a .env file
3. It should have this format:

FILE_PATH = ""
SCREEN_WIDTH = 
SCREEN_HEIGHT = 

file path is just going to be the name of your pdf file

4. go to the yorku courses website and click on "Plot My Timetable" and then click "Printable Version"

if you want to preserve colour of your timetable, download it from firefox as chrome doesn't allow that

5. drag your pdf file into the same folder as the WallPaperMaker.py file

6. run the python file

7. look in the joined folder for the final result (images and output are just some cool things you can look at)

*note: I haven't tested this with other phone dimensions and it only works with yorku schedules

Below is an example of the wallpapers the code produces
